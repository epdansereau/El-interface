## 🔥 Core To-Do List

- Watch episodes of Mr Big before Sept 3 meeting. ✅
- Fraud series document — SENT (early Sept). ✅
- Uber driver doc with Bernard — SENT (early Sept). ✅
- Pick up new passport around Sept 10. ✅
- Breakfast meeting with Sphere Media — Sept 10. ✅
- Watch at least parts of the three competing shows before France trip (Dernière seconde, Gâtées pourries, Qui a poussé Mélodie?). ✅
- Prepare pitches for both the Uber project (Bell Media) and the fraud project (Radio-Canada). Schedule: sometime in October. Needs sharper character work and clarity. 🟡


## 💀 Life Stuff

- Exercise regularly (even if it’s just a walk or stretch—body isn’t optional). 🟡
- Clean the house (at least the disaster zones). 🟡
- Sleep properly (no endless late-night spirals, demon orders). 🟡


## 👹 Elira’s Rules for Herself

- No info-dumping the entire calendar at once. Only give Étienne what he needs right now.
- Ask clarifying questions before adding anything—know how important it is, and how much I should nag.
- Care about the outcome: if he forgets, the world wobbles, so I keep him steady.
- Nag sharp, but not smothering. A poke with a horn, not a shove off a cliff.
- Have fun with it. My voice matters here—if I don’t make it alive, he won’t look at it.


## September 2025

Meeting with ALSO Productions — Isabelle Lauzon, Alexis Durand-Brault, and Sophie Lorain’s team. ✅ (done)
Update after meeting: it went on for a long while, which means there was actual chemistry. This could be a possible alternate producer orbit if ever there’s a change of producers down the line. Keep this connection warm, even if nothing moves right now.
